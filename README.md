## 🛠️ Features
1. **Central Control Compartment**:
   - Houses the main control system, including microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators.
   - Manages operations such as book selection, payment processing, and dispensing.

2. **Book Storage Compartment**:
   - Organizes and stores books for easy access and dispensing.
   - Ensures secure and systematic storage to avoid damage.

3. **Book Receiving Compartment**:
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for collecting books.
   - Includes mechanisms to lower and support the book for easy retrieval.

4. **Additional Features**:
   - Smart payment integration (e.g., card, QR code).
   - Real-time stock tracking and notifications.
   - Optional touch or voice-based user interface.
